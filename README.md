# UE4SSMods

My collection of mods made in UE4SS. Currently, the only public mod in this repo is the Strive frame advantage mod.

Build instructions can be found at [the main UE4SS repo](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS).

Both StriveFrameData-dll.rar and StriveFrameData-pak.rar are necessary to use this mod. To install the dll mod, extract into (steam folder)\GUILTY GEAR STRIVE\RED\Binaries\Win64. The pak mod may be installed as a normal mod into ~mods or with Unverum.
